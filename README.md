# Phase 2 Project

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, we set to understand the housing market in King County to establish the factors that determine the pricing of the houses.
Specifically, as our objective, we will set to determine whether the grading, condition and what other factors significantly affect the house prices

## FINDINGS
!("picture/RenPrice.png")
From the above, we have seen that houses that have been renovated are more costly than those not renovated
!("picture/GradPrice.png")
From the above we can observe that houses with higher grades have a higher price
## Conclusion & Recommendations
We can conclude that the price of renovated houses is 84,000 more than houses that have not been renovated
The higher the grading of a house, the higher the price of the house
For stake holders to maximize on sales of their houses they have to ensure that:
	* Houses are renovated as soon as they show any signs of dilapidation
	* The houses earn a high grading from the municipality as this has been seen to have an effect on pricing
